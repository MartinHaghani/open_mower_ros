# Agent operations

Purpose: operate and maintain the repository's agent context, documentation, Git,
subagent, validation, and scheduled-audit system.

## What loads for a new agent

Codex automatically loads the root `AGENTS.md` and the closest nested `AGENTS.md`
files. The root guide routes the agent to three startup sources:

1. [PROJECT_STATE.md](PROJECT_STATE.md) for the compact current snapshot;
2. [PLANS.md](../PLANS.md) and the applicable active ExecPlan for substantial work;
3. the `project-operations` skill for the task lifecycle.

The skill uses progressive disclosure: Codex sees its name and description at
startup and loads its full workflow only when a repository change, review, handoff,
or tracking task matches. Stable architecture and operations docs are read only when
the task needs them.

## Sources of truth

| Information | Authority |
|---|---|
| Durable agent rules | root and nested `AGENTS.md` |
| Current cross-project snapshot | [PROJECT_STATE.md](PROJECT_STATE.md) |
| Complex in-flight implementation | `docs/exec-plans/active/` |
| Durable decision and rationale | `docs/decisions/` |
| Outstanding work | [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/MartinHaghani/open_mower_ros/issues) |
| Canonical repository and integration base | `scripts/agent/project-policy.json` |
| Current system behavior | stable docs and implementation |
| Implementation/validation history | commits and pull requests |

Never turn `PROJECT_STATE` into a backlog or copy volatile issue status into stable
reference docs. Preserve decision rationale, alternatives, consequences, evidence,
and uncertainty; do not store raw chain-of-thought or uncurated transcripts.

## Local setup

Install and enable pre-commit in a development environment:

```bash
python3 -m pip install pre-commit
pre-commit install
pre-commit install --hook-type commit-msg
```

Project hooks under `.codex/hooks.json` are code and run only after the repository
is trusted. In Codex CLI, use `/hooks` to inspect the exact definitions and trust
their current hash. Review them again whenever `.codex/hooks.json` or its referenced
scripts change.

The hooks are intentionally bounded:

- `SessionStart` reports branch/status plus the current-state and plan routes.
- `SubagentStart` injects the evidence and one-writer handoff boundary.
- `Stop` runs deterministic hygiene checks and returns actionable warnings. It does
  not edit prose, stage, commit, push, merge, or delete anything.

CI is authoritative because local hooks can be skipped or untrusted.

The policy workflow validates every non-merge commit in normal topic-branch pushes
and pull requests, including Conventional Commit syntax and the labeled rationale,
validation, and issue evidence required for substantive changes. Dependabot's
canonical generated subjects receive subject-only handling only on a Dependabot
event and when the commit author is the Dependabot bot; ordinary commits in the
same range keep normal evidence requirements. Reviewed squash commits may use the
fully validated PR handoff sections as their evidence body. CI reads
`scripts/agent/commit-message-exceptions.json` from the immutable comparison
base. The first clean bootstrap uses a known-empty registry, so a pull request
cannot add an exception that waives its own commits. Issue #10 still owns the
independent trust boundary needed to prevent a pull request from weakening the
workflow itself.

## Run the policy checks

From the repository root, use the commands documented by the project-operations
skill:

```bash
python3 scripts/agent/check_project_hygiene.py --root . --scope all
python3 -m unittest discover -s scripts/agent/tests -p 'test_*.py'
python3 scripts/agent/evaluate_agent_context.py
python3 .github/scripts/test_validate_pr.py
python3 scripts/agent/validate_commit_message.py \
  --range <base-commit>..HEAD \
  --exceptions scripts/agent/commit-message-exceptions.json
pre-commit run
git diff --check
```

For a task branch, the validator infers its base from

1. explicit `--base`;
2. `PROJECT_HYGIENE_BASE`;
3. the uniquely matching active ExecPlan baseline;
4. `integration_base` in `scripts/agent/project-policy.json`;
5. the default branch only as a legacy fallback.

`project-policy.json` is the machine source of truth; `PROJECT_STATE.md` mirrors
it for humans. When the integration line changes or is retired, update both files
and the affected workflow branch filters in the same reviewed change.

Use an explicit base when inference is ambiguous:

```bash
python3 scripts/agent/check_project_hygiene.py \
  --root . \
  --scope changed \
  --base <task-baseline-commit>
```

The validator checks project-state and ExecPlan structure, ADR indexing, local
Markdown links, issue-linked TODO/FIXME markers, and required documentation impact
for sensitive path families. It validates structure and evidence routing; a human or
review agent still evaluates whether the semantics are true.

Pre-commit is a changed-file ratchet while [issue #21](https://github.com/MartinHaghani/open_mower_ros/issues/21)
owns inherited full-tree debt. Stage only the intended paths, then run
`pre-commit run`; CI compares the event base with `HEAD`. Do not use an all-files
run to autoformat unrelated baseline code. The JSON formatter deliberately skips
the generator/schema-owned config schema and package lock while `check-json` still
validates their syntax.

## Agent roles and delegation

Project roles live under `.codex/agents/`:

- `explorer`: read-only repository evidence gathering;
- `test_analyst`: focused test/build/log selection and interpretation;
- `correctness_reviewer`: read-only correctness and safety review;
- `docs_state_auditor`: read-only source-of-truth and handoff consistency review.

The parent agent keeps requirements, decisions, integration, and final reporting.
Use subagents for bounded independent exploration, testing, and review. Assign one
writer per file/workstream; concurrent writers require separate worktrees and a
single integrator. The checked-in Codex config caps concurrency at four threads and
nested delegation at one level.

When adding a role, give it one job, explicit write permissions, a required output
format, and a prohibition on recursive delegation. Do not create overlapping roles
to simulate a large team where one focused agent is enough.

## Issue and pull-request workflow

Issue forms require outcome, evidence, scope, safety, acceptance, dependencies, and
verification. Discovered work outside the active task becomes a linked issue rather
than hidden scope growth or an unowned TODO.

Pull requests require:

- a Conventional Commit-style title;
- linked issue and ExecPlan or a reason the plan is unnecessary;
- outcome and key decisions;
- documentation impact;
- safety and rollback;
- exact verification with observed results;
- known limitations and follow-up issues.

Routine topic-branch creation, commits, pushes, and draft PRs are automatic for an
authorized implementation task. Merge, direct default-branch or integration-base
push, force-push, history rewriting, deployment, and live mower/VESC actions remain
human-gated.
Questions, explanations, read-only status or review reports, and diagnosis-only
tasks do not create repository tracking or Git changes unless the maintainer asks
for them.

## Adoption by older agents

An already-running Codex task does not retroactively reload repository instructions.
After this operating system lands, its landing/squash commit must be recorded in
[PROJECT_STATE.md](PROJECT_STATE.md). In an older task branch, check adoption with:

```bash
git merge-base --is-ancestor <agent-os-landed-commit> HEAD
test -f AGENTS.md
test -f .agents/skills/project-operations/SKILL.md
```

If the ancestor check fails, the task is not adopted. Create or link any missing
issue, topic branch, and plan required by the task, or queue the missing GitHub item
in the plan when access is unavailable; then checkpoint unique work. Do not checkout,
rebase, reset, or clean a dirty worktree to install policy. Integrate the landed
operating-system commit only in a clean reviewable state, review and trust the
checked-in hooks, and then start a new Codex task so `AGENTS.md` and the project
skill load at startup. Coordinator prompts alone are not proof that a branch has
adopted the system.

## Current GitHub governance

Verified and applied on 2026-07-15 to `MartinHaghani/open_mower_ros`:

- Issues enabled and the initial backlog plus legacy TODO ownership migrated to
  issues #1–#21;
- squash-only merges using PR title/body;
- automatic deletion of merged branches;
- `main` requires a PR, linear history, and resolved conversations;
- admin enforcement is enabled; force-push and branch deletion are disabled;
- zero required approvals because the repository currently has only one
  collaborator and GitHub does not permit approving one's own PR.

The temporary integration branch `codex/remove-lowlevel-board` is not yet proven
PR-only by live settings. Never push it directly. Issue #10 owns protecting that ref
or retiring it into `main` before this operating system is relied on as a required
governance boundary.

The checked-in policy workflow exposes the stable `Project policy / policy-gate`
check. Do not make it required until this workflow is present on the protected
branch and has passed representative PRs. Track that rollout in
[issue #10](https://github.com/MartinHaghani/open_mower_ros/issues/10).

Before requiring it, also establish an independent trust boundary for changes to
the workflow, validators, hooks, skills, and agent instructions. A PR-controlled
workflow can otherwise weaken its own checks while keeping the same status name.
Issue #10 owns the ruleset, trusted-workflow, or independent-review solution.

CODEOWNERS identifies safety and governance ownership, but mandatory CODEOWNER
approval must wait for an independent trusted reviewer; otherwise every PR becomes
unmergeable.

## Legacy TODO ratchet

[legacy-todos.json](legacy-todos.json) maps each pre-policy first-party marker to an
assigned issue by exact source text. It is a bounded migration register, not an
alternative backlog:

- new TODO/FIXME markers require an inline issue reference;
- changing or deleting a registered marker makes hygiene fail until its register
  entry is updated or removed;
- adding a register exception for new work is prohibited;
- when a source marker gains an inline issue link, remove its register entry.

Third-party and generated trees remain outside this ownership policy.

## GitHub Project rollout

The intended Projects v2 view uses:

- Status: Backlog, Ready, In progress, Review, Blocked, Done;
- Priority: P0, P1, P2, P3;
- Area: agent operations, coverage planner, localization, hardware, WebUI, and
  other repository domains as needed;
- Risk: normal, high, safety-critical;
- Owner.

Configure automatic addition of repository issues and PRs plus status movement for
opened/closed/merged items. Project creation requires the GitHub CLI token's separate
`project` scope; repository administration alone is insufficient. Refresh the scope
and complete issue #10 from an authenticated maintainer session:

```bash
gh auth refresh -s read:project -s project
```

Do not duplicate Project status in Markdown after rollout. `PROJECT_STATE` should
show only the few active workstreams and their authoritative links.

## Scheduled gardening

The two existing Codex desktop jobs are paused because their prompts still target
the parked ALM migration. They are not OpenMower automation evidence. After this
operating system lands, retarget them without changing their schedules or safety
gates: verify `origin` resolves to `MartinHaghani/open_mower_ros`, use the integration
ref recorded in [PROJECT_STATE.md](PROJECT_STATE.md), create issues and draft PRs
only in that repository, and fail closed if any authority check differs. Never push
the parked `alm` remote. Issue #10 owns this gated reactivation.

Once reactivated, `OpenMower project hygiene` audits documentation, project state,
active plans, ADRs, issues/PRs, worktrees, deterministic checks, and governance each
Monday. It may configure the documented Project or require the policy gate only
after OAuth, workflow, and independent-trust prerequisites are proven.

The four-week `OpenMower agent context regression` job samples at least three
risk-balanced evaluation cases with three trials per case when supported, records
raw measures, and updates issue #11. This periodic sample does not replace the full
candidate cohort required before merging material context-policy changes.

It may open issues or a draft PR for bounded low-risk repairs. It must not merge,
force-push, delete unique worktrees, change mower runtime code, deploy, alter live
VESC settings, or perform physical tests. Review the first several runs and refine
the prompt if it produces false positives or broad changes. Archive old scheduled
runs so their worktrees do not accumulate.

## Evaluate performance

Use [agent-evals/README.md](agent-evals/README.md) and its twelve representative cases
to compare fresh-agent orientation, restart success, unsupported claims, human
corrections, documentation drift, end-state correctness, tool use, and tokens.
Deterministic structural checks run in CI; stochastic model trials run manually or
on a schedule in disposable worktrees. Never treat a single model sample as a merge
gate.

## Change the operating system

Update `AGENTS.md` only for durable rules or repeated failure patterns. Put a
repeatable workflow in the skill, mechanical enforcement in validators/hooks/CI,
volatile status in `PROJECT_STATE` or an active plan, durable choices in an ADR, and
outstanding work in an issue.

Material changes to instructions, plans, hooks, roles, or hygiene checks require:

1. an issue and, when complex, an active ExecPlan;
2. documentation and backward-compatibility review;
3. deterministic policy tests;
4. a documentation-state audit and correctness review;
5. representative cases from the agent evaluation suite;
6. a draft PR with rollback instructions.
